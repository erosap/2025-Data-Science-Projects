    "I am very impressed with the output of the LLM. It accurately extracted each portion of the pdf file that it was asked to do. I did notice that I had to correctly label certain parts such as Discount versus Additional Discount to accuratly extract both of them. I first tested with just Discount and it was attributed to 12%. Finally, when I correctly labeled both, both were accurately brought in. It also accurately added a percentage but only when I asked it too otherwise the percentage was displayed as a number which may cause problems in a pipeline. My final thoughts on this is that the model needs some tweaking to get it right because it does almost exactly what you ask it to do. If you are not precise then it will make its own judgement and may not accurately do what you asked such as turning  adiscount into a percentage unless explcitiely asked. "
