The main shifts are at the end of August and the beginning of September, both seeing a 15% surge. There is a cyclical flow every 3 months of 10-12% variance, tracking a quarterly high to low pattern. It would not be accurate to have an across-the-board increase in staffing as the variance is month-end-driven, but it is advisable to add staff for the quarter-end surges. This pattern suggests there may be a quarterly billing or reporting cycle customers participate in. Additionally, quarter 4-5, May and June, show a 7% increase for holidays. So, while 5% is typical for influx in customer service volume, a 7% increase worth in staffing is worth considering.\n"

    "Fine-tuning my model involved multiple iterative steps and refinements. Initially, when I created prompt examples, the model's output was limited to generic text responses without providing any forecasts or actuals. In fact, it often responded with placeholder language indicating that it would begin the task shortly. After significantly revising the examples in my fine-tuned dataset, the model began generating forecasts and actuals; however, the results were inconsistent. In some instances, it only produced data for a few weeks. To address this, I further refined the training examples to include explicit formatting for forecasts and actuals. This led to improved performance, although the output still varied considerably depending on the prompt used. Ultimately, I enhanced the prompt during inference to specify the desired output format clearly. This combination of fine-tuning and prompt engineering yielded the most reliable results, as demonstrated in my final example. Overall, this project provided a comprehensive learning experience in the end-to-end process of fine-tuning a language model and optimizing prompts to achieve targeted outputs. I was particularly impressed by the model’s ability to analyze data for trends, seasonality, outliers, and cyclical patterns."
