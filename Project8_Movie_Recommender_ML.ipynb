    "The process is quite simple. The process is to take the movie ratings and create a matrix of correlations. As we have learned, correlations can be used to test the strength of relationships between two variables. In this case, a high positive correlation means that if a user rated one movie highly, they they are likely to rate the recommended movie highly as well. What the model does when a user selects a movie is to retrieve the list of the movies with the ten highest correlations and then recommended them to the user. "
